I was just looking for a game to spend my money and so I remembered this game “Stardew Valley”. I’ve heard nothing but good things about this game and I’ve also been looking for a game similar to Harvest Moon for PC. I immediately bought it at full price and what came to me after I played it for a few hours is just amazing. The first thing I’ve thought after playing for a few hours is, “It’s definitely worth it’s price, no, way more than that, this game has way more to offer than any other big games that has been coming out lately.”&nbsp;</div>

The game came out in 2016 and has had a very high reputation ever since. The game starts with the intro, with music that is good, just fitting to the style of the game. You create your character then off you go. The game itself starts with a young person, your character, who is seen to be working tirelessly in a lifeless office. The young person then remembered the letter their grandfather gave them when they were younger. The letter leads the young person to an abandoned lot in Pelican Town which is located in the hills of Stardew Valley. In this land, is where you start your journey.</p>

                               Things start with you plowing the land, planting seeds, then watering them. Just like a normal farm life. When you go into the town, you will see the townsfolks, which you can interact with. Interactions with these people grants you point for the Friendship mechanic of the game. I started by doing things that I know of and I also started wandering around for new discoveries. Every morning just started with me watering the crops, tending to my farm, and after that, I would go to different places of the town. Around the town there are items that are usually lying around that you can pick up or forage. Foraging is very good and helpful thing in the game, as not only can it help you with a lot of things, but these are just things that you can just pick up anywhere and stack up into your inventory.</p>

The whole farm is full of trees and grasses at first which should be cleaned as you grow up your farm. There are four seasons in this game, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Each season has 28 days, therefore one month and an entire year consists of only them. Each season also comes with different wonderful occasions.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8">There’s also the fishing mechanic, where you can whip out your fishing rod to bodies of water and wait for something to catch the bait. In fishing, you can get different fishes of some sort, some items that come from underwater and sometimes even treasure chests which could contain large loot. Then there’s also the mining mechanic, you just basically go to the cave, use pickaxes to mine rocks, slay some monsters, and get the loot. The cave increases its level of monsters and loot at so descend in floors. As the floor level increases, your equipment level should also increase as most of the things needed to upgrade them is in the cave. From these interactions, you will get wonderful stories about these people. Then comes the crafting mechanic, you gather materials so you can craft different objects that might be helpful to you in many things. You can get blueprints in many various ways. There’s a lot of way to earn money in this game, from farming, fishing, foraging, to making and selling artisan goods.</div>

Growing relationships with the townsfolks is definitely worth it as they are well-written characters. You basically start talking with them. Conversations starts off very casual, and the relationships deepen, it gets more personal. You start from being acquaintances, to being friends, and possibly to some people who are around your age, to being a couple. From these interactions, you will get wonderful stories about these people. The game has shown its openness to everyone by allowing same-sex marriage, which just increased my respect to the developer.&nbsp;</p>
