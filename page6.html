The story is about Vito Scaletta and his rise to the life of crime. It started with him getting caught during a robbery where he got enlisted to be sent to the war and came back to home to get right back into business.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Mafia 2 brings us a compelling story of a man who got himself involved with wars, violence, alliances, betrayals, bloodsheds and crime. He was accompanied by Joe Barbaro, his best friend, as he gets into different crimes involving the different crime families.  Starting from small heists to selling black-market gas coupons and so on. Eventually, as their reputation increases to the mafias, things get heavier for them. Throughout the game, Vito meets new people, both friends and enemies. We play as he get himself to making hard decisions and watch how the consequences of his actions gets crueler and crueler. The storytelling and the narrative of the game is amazing. The voice acting is also amazing; it carries the emotion of each characters most of the time. Every cutscenes is very much like a movie where you sense the emotions of the characters through the tone of their voice and their movements. The greatness of the story itself and the realism of its characters is enough for me to say that it is worth it the money.
</p><p>
</p><p>Just like in the previous game, the game follows a linear style of storytelling despite the big map it is set on. Though you can still free roam on missions where you have to drive to a certain location to actually start the mission. You can go to clothing stores where you can buy outfits of your choice. You can also go to gun shops to get guns and ammos which you won’t most likely need as you already have weapons at the beginning of every missions and ammos are not even scarce throughout missions. Other than that, you do small jobs like towing cars for money which you won’t also need as every mission already rewards you with good money.

                            <p class="mbr-text align-right mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The game is very authentic when it comes to its setting and its attention to detail is one of a kind in terms of quality. From the vehicles, to the music, everything is just authentic. It makes you feel like you’re actually in the 1940s America. The overall look of the Empire Bay changes, depending on the year and the season the story takes place in. In the beginning of the game, the year is 1945 and it is winter. You will see people wear thick clothes and does things as if they are actually humans. The car models are still old on the other hand. You will see people on the road struggling to fix their car. It really feels as if you were living in the 1940s. At some point in the story, the year will fast forward to 1951. The overall look the city has changed and some new models of cars has arrived. New music can also be heard from the radios. This just shows how the developers gave care to their attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

Thankfully, the law isn’t as strict here as it is in the first game where the police will pull you over by running past a red light. Overspeeding, on the other hand, will still get you fined or arrested. Fortunately, it is easier to run off the cops in this game since the car handling is easier and fun unlike in the previous game.</p>

                            <p class="mbr-text align-right mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The game also stands out in terms of animations. The animations of this game feels very realistic and flawless. The game has a hand-to-hand combat mechanic. You can go for a light attack, heavy attack and block. There is a point in the story where this mechanic will be heavily used. The shooting mechanic is just the basic cover based shooter most of the time where you just have to wait for the enemy to peak so you can go for the kill as rushing your enemies is not a really bright idea as you will be easily killed once they pinned you down and the weapons has their weight so you can just spray and pray. A single shot in the head is enough to kill your enemies. The weapons in this game is another thing that I would say is really authentic. Each weapons feels like they have their own unique weight on them. The gun animations are very satisfying and the gun sound effects are really powerful. The levels in this game are well made, there are just enough places for you and your enemies. The destructibility of the environment also adds up to the chaos. The game also has a stealth mechanic. It is not used a lot in the game but it is simple and good. These three mechanics are really well-implemented and does not feel like it’s lacking at all.</p>

Nothing feels like it’s lacking. The graphics and the attention to detail still holds up today. The story is just absolutely amazing. It really is something that I would call a masterpiece. The richness of the storytelling and the characters truly is something. The game also made sure that all the features and content that it has is not put to waste by putting you in situations where you have to use them. It is easy to see the amount of work and effort the developers have put on this game by playing it. This game is something that I would love to call a masterpiece. I recommend it.</div>
